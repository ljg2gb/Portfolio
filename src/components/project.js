        <p>sample text for a paragraph..Maybe delete later maybe include card instead with ability to flip for more deatils/ a way to expand the card to read more aboutt the project. Maybe each project gets their own page and you can click on the project box to go to the project page or you can click on the github link from the home page to take you directly to the page on Github. This is more text to fill more space.</p>
    </div>
